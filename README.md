#### Installation
You should install this kext along with the plugin kexts depending on it.  
The prebuilt binaries are available on [releases](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu/releases) page.  
Several existing plugins possibly with code samples are available on [known plugins](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu/blob/master/KnownPlugins.md) page.
To compile a plugin copy the debug version of Lilu.kext into its directory.

#### Configuration
Add `-liludbg` to enable debug printing (available in DEBUG binaries).  
Add `-liluoff` to disable Lilu.  
Add `-liluslow` to enable legacy user patcher.  
Add `-lilulowmem` to disable kernel unpack (disables Lilu in recovery mode).  
Add `-lilubeta` to enable Lilu on unsupported os versions (10.13 and below are enabled by default).  
Add `-lilubetaall` to enable Lilu and all loaded plugins on unsupported os versions (use _very_ carefully)  
Add `-liluforce` to enable Lilu regardless of the os, installer, or recovery.
